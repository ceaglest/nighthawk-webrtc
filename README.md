Nighthawk WebRTC
================

Custom iOS builds of Google's [Chromium WebRTC project](http://www.webrtc.org).

## Setup

### Cocoapods

You can include a pre-built version of Nighthawk via Cocoapods. Only available directly for now.

```
pod 'nighthawk-webrtc', :git => 'https://github.com/ceaglest/nighthawk-webrtc.git'
```

### Modifying WebRTC

Patches are currently applied against Chrome 45. See [working with WebRTC release branches](http://www.webrtc.org/native-code/development#TOC-Working-with-Release-Branches) for a primer on how to prepare your working copy.
